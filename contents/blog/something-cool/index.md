I started making web pages back in the late 90s. But I didn't truly learn beyond the HTML and templates until now. I just finished an intense 6 months getting a certificate from Columbia University here in New York, NY to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. 

Working with data and coming up with interesting and unique ways to store it for analytics is fun, but my passion definitely lies in the beauty of the end user experience. After years of getting paid in my full-time roles to be the hyper-organized, detail-oriented data and supply guru, I'm ready to blend those skills with my highly artistic side to work as a Front End Developer full-time. 

And now, I'll be presenting my project, musabilty, at Trilogy's Demo Day on Wednesday! I'm very excited for the chance to show what I have so far on a project that is so close to my heart and gather useful feedback to help improve it as I keep chugging along on the build. 

It doesn't hurt to get to speak with people face-to-face either! Being so new (and yet not) to this field can be daunting. But I'm someone who has been around the block and I'm far too bubbly to be part of what's considered the norm personality in tech. I choose to see that as my secret weapon for success. 

I'm excited to see how Demo Day goes and report back. See you on the other side!
